Summary: How to use this site


Erdos is an educational site for learning about and practicing
[Network Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science) through programming exercises, problem solving, and open-ended questions that introduce and teach the fundamentals of this field.

## Problem Sets

The [problem sets](categories.html) are the main resource Erdos offers. They aim at teaching
the basics (and not so basics) of Network Science through hands-on problem solving. To do these exercises, you will need a minimal knowledge of any programming language.

If you don't feel comfortable with things such as control flow, lists, and
reading and writing files, you can check out a python tutorial
[here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). Some of the more advanced
problems require a deeper knowledge of algorithms and data structures, as
well as a bit of
[graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory). However, Erdos
aims to be as self-contained as possible, and you will be offered pointers
and further resources when necessary.

### Categories

The problem sets are grouped by category and roughly sorted by difficulty
inside each category. It is recommended to get familiar with the basic
content of one category before jumping to the next, but you should also feel
free to follow your curiosity.

### Solutions

Erdos provides solutions to the programming challenges, and hints or full answers
to questions and exercises. We encourage you to leave a link to your
solution on the comment section of each problem. We'll try to let you know how it looks!

## Glossary

Problems include definitions of important concepts in Network Science. They
are all compiled in the [Glossary](/glossary.html).
