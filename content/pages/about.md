Erdos has been inspired by projects like
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) for math and programming,
[ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/about/) for bioinformatics, and the
[cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) for cryptography.

Erdos is open source and free of charge. You can contribute directly on our
GitHub page, [here](https://github.com/Leockard/erdos/). Erdos uses
[python](https://www.python.org/) to generate the site, with the help of
[pelican](http://getpelican.com/),
[elegant-theme](http://oncrashreboot.com/pelican-elegant), and
[markdown-pp](https://github.com/jreese/markdown-pp). Most solutions are
also written in python.

If you have any question, comment, suggestion, or would like to contribute
to Erdos, we would like to hear form you! You can find the contact
information to the right of this page.
