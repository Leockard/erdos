Title: How To

Erdos is an educational site for learning about Network Science based on
programming problem-solving and open-ended exercises and questions.

## NetSci Primer

If you're curious about NetSci, but don't know what it is or where to
begin, you can read the primer here. If that piques your interest, continue
reading.


## Problem Sets

The problem sets are the main resource Erdos offers. They aim at teaching
the basics (and not so basics) of Network Science with an approach based on
hands-on problem solving. To solve the problems, you will need a minimal
knowledge of any programming language. Erdos uses python to showcase
solutions, and for generating the site itself, with pelican and
elegant-theme.

If you don't feel comfortable with things such as control flow, lists, and
reading and writing files, you can check out a python tutorial here.
